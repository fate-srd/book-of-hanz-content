it doesn&#39;t actually say anything we would all consider an &quot;episode&quot; has happened yet.<br><br>In other words, let&#39;s assume a 5 player group, A, B, C, D, and E.<br><br>A has previously met B and C.<br><br>B has previously met A and D.<br><br>C has previously met A and E.<br><br>D has previously me B and E.<br><br>E has previously met C and D.<br><br>Phase Trio complete, but the group hasn&#39;t actually met yet!  They&#39;ve crossed paths, but not combined into what the story wants of them.<br><br>Your experience may be less neat, of course.  More clumping around one character, that sort of thing.<br><br>I see this as a tool to avoid the &quot;you meet in a tavern&quot; clumsy open rather than a restriction on where you have to start your story.<br><br>Of course, you can always follow the FAE style and start play without those 3 aspects and create them during the &quot;pilot&quot;.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+RobertHanz" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Robert Hanz</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-01-09T17:16:58-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Oh, I agree, it&#39;s not that different.  I&#39;m just used to seeing very disparate stories from characters that don&#39;t really tie into the game premise, and having some issues with figuring out how all the time synchronizes appropriately as well.<br><br>I don&#39;t see it as a restriction on &quot;where you start your story&quot; either.  It just seems like the first six or so episodes of any TV series are about establishing characters and relationships, and that the show really takes off after that.<br><br>And I&#39;m wondering if framing the stories in terms of &quot;early episodes&quot; might have some value in terms of helping both define kind of a shape for those stories, make them have more potentially relevant information, help bring about more table consensus on the direction of the game, etc.<br><br>I also think it&#39;s probably a bit closer to the SotC &quot;first novel&quot; idea in some ways than many of the stories I&#39;ve gotten in practice, many of which are just vignettes, and really have no &#39;story structure&#39; whatsoever - which is fine, but those often don&#39;t really give much in the way of ongoing threads.<br><br>And there&#39;s no reason an &quot;episode&quot; couldn&#39;t be a flashback, either :)<br><br>It&#39;s not a drastic change that I&#39;m talking about here so much as a slightly different framing.</div></div><div class="comment" itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"><span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+JackGulick" class="author" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jack Gulick</span></a></span><span class="time"> - <span itemprop="dateCreated">2014-01-09T17:24:23-0500</span></span><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text">Consider the structure of Firefly, which actually has two pilot episodes because of Fox TV silliness...<br><br>It&#39;s more traditional &quot;we all meet up&quot;
